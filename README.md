## Course Assignments

This is the Unix Assignment for BCB 546 Class at Iowa State. 

All files created for the Maize SNPS are in the "maizefolder". All files created for the Teosinte SNPS are in the "teosfolder". All other files created are in the "extrafiles" folder to clear things up. 

The code and description of the code I used are in the Phelps_Sarah_Unix_Assignment.md folder.
